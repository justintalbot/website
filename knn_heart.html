<h1>KNN and Inspiration</h1>
<p>I have been reading about KNN in <a href="https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/">Introduction to Statistical Learning</a>. In searching for real world uses I came across <a href="http://www.ijiet.org/papers/114-K0009.pdf">this</a></p>
<p>It mentions the standard dataset used to measure the effectiveness of different machine learning models on predicting heart disease. After another quick google search I found the dataset mentioned on the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php">UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s read in the data and attempt our own implementation on this dataset.</p>

<div id="clean-the-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Clean the data</h3>
<p>The data is already very clean, but a few minor changes are needed.</p>
<p>Two of the columns have “?” in them. We will remove these entries.</p>
<p>Also, the variable we want to predict, num, has values from 0 to 4. Where 0 means the patient does not have heart disease and 1, 2, 3, and 4 are differing levels 0f severity for heart disease. We will change this to a binary variable, having or not having, or 0 or 1.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># ca and thal have &quot;?&quot; entries. Remove those
heart &lt;- heart_disease %&gt;%
  filter(ca != &quot;?&quot;, thal != &quot;?&quot;)

heart$ca &lt;- as.numeric(heart$ca)  
heart$thal &lt;- as.numeric(heart$thal)

# The value we want to predict, num, has values 0 - 4. We only want heart disease/no heart disease
heart &lt;- mutate(heart, num = ifelse(num &gt;= 1, 1, 0))</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="standardizing-the-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Standardizing the data</h3>
<p>KNN works by first training the dataset and grouping the data based on our variables into two groups, having and not having heart diseases. Based on this, the test set is then placed into one of the two groups based on the distance to the k (the number of nodes we choose) nearest neighbors.</p>
<p>We are using the Euclidian distance, or “as the crow flies”. Because of this, differences in measurement metrics can affect our results.</p>
<p>For example, Ted is 100cm tall and John is 1 meter. Without standardization Ted is 99 units taller than John. Therefore, we standardize all of our variables to be values between 0 and 1.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Now we have to standardize the entries as values between 0 and 1
normalize &lt;- function(x) {
  return ((x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x)))
}

heart_unstandardized &lt;- heart
heart[,1:13] &lt;- as.data.frame(lapply(heart[1:13], normalize))</code></pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>With a few lines of code we were able to achieve nearly 88% accuracy. The problem with an algorithm such as k-nn is that it doesn’t tell us which variables are most important in measuring heart disease. In other words, it is accurate for this dataset, but it is a bit of a black box.</p>
<p>In future projects I would like to try and implement K-NN on other datasets that are less well known.</p>
<p>This is a new algorithm for me. I was a little loosey goosey with some of my descriptions. So if you see any mistakes or if I over simplified anything, shoot me an email at [<a href="mailto:justin.m.talbot@gmail.com">justin.m.talbot@gmail.com</a>]</p>
